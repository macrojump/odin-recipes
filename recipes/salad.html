    <h2>Grilled Romaine ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients needed for this delicious grilled romaine salad:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon tried thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 shallots, halved lengthwise and peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>4 romaine hearts</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Mix olive oil, white sugar, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Place tomatoes in the bag, seal, and shake to coat. Arrange coated tomato halves cut side up on a baking sheet. Bake tomatoes 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove from heat, and let cool.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>In a blender or food processor, finely chop the shallots. Add vinegar and brown sugar, and process until smooth. Slowly add 1 3/4 cups oil, processing frequently, so as to thicken the mixture.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Preheat grill for high heat. Brush romaine hearts with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Place romaine hearts on the preheated grill. Cook 5 to 10 minutes, turning frequently, until slightly charred but not heated all the way through. Serve warm on salad plates surrounded by tomato pieces and drizzled with the shallot dressing.</p>
