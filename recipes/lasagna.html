    <h2>Homemade Lasagna ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
