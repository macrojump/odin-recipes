    <h1>Rolls</h1>
    <h2>Rosemary Pull-Apart Dinner Rolls</h2>
    <p>As far as holiday dinner rolls go, these are pretty lean. You can increase the amount of melted butter and toss in a egg or two, but since these are generally going to be eaten with fairly rich food, I prefer a lighter approach.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon milk</li>
        <li>corase sea salt to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Set aside in a warm place until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Combine 1 cup milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook until butter is melted, 3 to 4 minutes; remove pan from heat.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast mixture, honey, 1 teaspoon salt, rosemary, and milk mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; mix on low until no dry spots remain. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue adding flour until a firm dough forms that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead on medium until elastic and soft but still tacky, about 6 minutes. Transfer dough to a clean bowl and coat with olive oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Transfer dough to a work surface and shape into a rectangle about 1-inch thick. Cut into 36 equally-sized pieces. Form each piece into a ball, pinching the seams on the underside, creating a smooth, round top.</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Lightly beat egg with 1 teaspoon milk in a small bowl.</p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>Transfer dough balls to the prepared baking sheet in 3 rows of 12, placing them close together but not touching. Brush tops lightly with the egg mixture and sprinkle with sea salt. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</p>
