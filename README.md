TheOdinProject Recipes README

Overview
Welcome to the README file for OdinProject Recipes! This document provides an overview of the HTML structure used in the project, highlighting the implementation of linking to images and subsequent pages.

HTML Structure
1. Links
In the HTML files, links play a crucial role in connecting different pages or external resources. Describe the organization and structure of links within your project. Highlight any special considerations or conventions you've followed.

Example:
```
<a href="page.html">Internal Link</a>
<a href="https://external-website.com" target="_blank">External Link</a>
```

2. Images
Images enhance the visual appeal of web pages. Outline how images are incorporated into your project and specify the sources or directories where the images are stored.

Example:
```
<img src="images/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```


3. Anchor Tags
Anchor tags are crucial for creating navigation within a page. Detail how anchor tags are used for smooth scrolling or to jump between sections within a page.

Example:
```
<a href="#section-id">Jump to Section</a>
```
